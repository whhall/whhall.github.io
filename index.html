Successful graduate of Midlands Technical College receiving a an Associates in Computer Technology and current undergraduate at the University of  South Carolina studying Information Science.  I been awarded and completed the TechHire scholarship for front-end programming.  Over six years of customer service makes me a unique combination of empathic and passionate about helping people fulfill their needs.  I achieve high levels of professionalism while maintaining organization through time management skills developed while working, and going to school, full-time.  Through my experiences I've learned about how customers interact with the systems built by health care, education, and service industry.  There are two common theme throughout all industries and that is Usability and accessibility.  Users need to be able to easily and consistently be able to access and use the information they need.  Innovating the way we communicate through the Internet is my dream. My main goal is to build robust, responsive, and beautiful website designs that generates repeat visits.  I want a customer to know on their initial visit they will be returning to my websites.</p>
