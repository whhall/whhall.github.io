			<p style="text-indent:50px;" class="text-justify">Information specialist focusing on web design and knowledge accessibility. Successful graduate of Midlands Technical College receiving an Associates in Computer Technology and current undergraduate at the University of South Carolina studying Information Science. I was awarded a scholarship and completed the TechHire program for front-end development. Over six years of customer service has given me a unique combination of empathy and passion for helping people fulfill their needs. I maintain high levels of professionalism and organization through time management skills, which I developed while working and going to school full-time. Through my experience I've learned how customers interact with systems in health care, education, and service industry. The two common themes throughout all industries are usability and accessibility.</p>

			<p style="text-indent:50px;" class="text-justify"> Innovating the way we communicate through the Internet is my dream. My main goal is to build robust, responsive, and beautiful website designs that generate repeat visits. Bridging the gap between the user and the developer, I want to ensure the customer knows, on their initial visit, exactly what to do to complete their mission and ensure their return.</p>

                    <p class="center px-3">Anvil Artistry is a creative contracting company that creates functional and beatiful art work.  This was my favorite project because I was able to work with a unique client with a huge and diverse portfolio.  I handled the large amount of images by creating a filterable gallery and categorizing to increase user experience.  Check them out by clicking the Anvil Artistry logo above this paragraph.</p>

                    <p class="center px-3">MIRCI is a non-profit orginization in the Columbia area. I was asked to create a website in which they can use to recieve donations and easily maintain and add new content.  I chose Wordpress as their content managment system to put the power in their hands.  Since Wordpress started as a blogging platform I felt it was the best option for an organization to easily create new content without having to call a developer every time they wanted to post an event or add news items.  Click on the MIRCI logo above to check out the template I created for them!</p>
